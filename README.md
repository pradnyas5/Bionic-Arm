# Bionic-Arm
A "7 DOF" position-controlled bionic arm designed to be used for on-desk tasks. The project was associated with **[Technodune Pvt. Ltd.](http://technodune.com/)**, a startup based out of Pune, India.

The arm was developed from scratch and included the following contributions:
  1. Mechanical assembly and design optimization.    
     Contributed to minor design improvements for dexterous manipulation.
  2. Hardware and sensor calibration.
  3. Software setup and testing.   
     Programmed ESP32S to transfer data from the arm to a webpage (and vice-versa) for robot arm control.   
     Implemented inverse kinematics to generate positional movement using an ATMega microcontroller.
