# Bionic-Arm
A "7 DOF" position-controlled bionic arm designed to be used for on-desk tasks. The project was associated with Technodune Pvt. Ltd., a startup based out of Pune, India.

The arm was developed from scratch and included the following contribution:
  1. Mechanical assembly and design optimization.
  2. Hardware and sensor calibration.
  3. Software setup and testing.

>  Contributed to minor design improvements for dexterous manipulation.
>  Implemented inverse kinematics to generate positional movement using ATMega microcontroller.
>  Programmed ESP32S to transfer data from arm to a webpage (vice-versa) for robot arm control.
